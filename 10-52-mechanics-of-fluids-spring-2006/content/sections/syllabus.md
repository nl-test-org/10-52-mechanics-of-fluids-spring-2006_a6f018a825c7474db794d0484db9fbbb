Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Overview
--------

This class is an advanced subject in fluid and continuum mechanics. The course content includes kinematics, macroscopic balances for linear and angular momentum, the stress tensor, creeping flows and the lubrication approximation, the boundary layer approximation, and linear stability theory.

Texts
-----

There is no required textbook for this course. However, students may find the following to be a useful reference:

Panton, Ronald L. _Incompressible Flow._ 3rd ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc, 2005. ISBN: 9780471261223.

A series of fluid mechanics films are given in [study materials]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials) section to supplement content presented in lectures.

Projects
--------

The class culminates in a final project consisting of a 1-hour, in-class presentation. The presentation is a critical review of a topic from current literature. Topics are selected by individual students and approved by faculty.

Grading
-------

Grades are determined by performance on the six problem sets given during the term, the final presentation, and in-class participation. There are no exams given in this class.
